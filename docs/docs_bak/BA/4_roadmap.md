# PicoClaw Landing Page - PRD

**Vision:** Create a distinctive, non-generic landing page for PicoClaw that reflects its:
- 1. Minimal, lightweight, fast aesthetic
2. Go programming language heritage
3. No CLI tool bureaucracy - direct action
4. 'Every bit helps, every bit matters' philosophy
5. $10 boards, <10MB RAM - extreme efficiency

**Key Visual Identity:**
- Lobster mascot theme (subtle, not cartoonish)
- Terminal/code-focused vibes
- Dark theme (terminal aesthetic)
- Monospace fonts for code sections
- Subtle lobster orange accents (#FF6B35)

- No fluff - straight to the point
